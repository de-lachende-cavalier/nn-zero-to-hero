## neural networks: zero to hero

A personal fork for Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) course, meant for experimentation and deepening my understanding of NN internals.

Andrej's (excellent) lectures are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) and the materials covered in them are in the [lectures](lectures/) directory, with some possible modifications of my own.

The [exercises](exercises/) directory contains the solved exercises, as included in the descriptions of the various videos.
